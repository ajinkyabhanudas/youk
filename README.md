## The compounding engineer

youk makes every Claude Code session smarter than the last. Working agreements you set verbally today are loaded automatically six months from now. Lessons from this project improve every project that follows. Skills evolve to catch your specific patterns, not generic ones.

| Without youk | With youk |
|---|---|
| Re-explain the project every session | Picks up where you left off — automatically |
| Working agreements live in chat, then vanish | Written to files, loaded at every future session |
| Generic AI regardless of task size or stack | Routed to the right ceremony for your context |
| Lessons lost when the session ends | Accumulated in audit log, feeding skill evolution |
| Same gaps recur across projects | Detected, promoted to cross-project knowledge |
| No institutional memory | Architecture decisions from six months ago still present today |

**What changes about your workflow: the install. Nothing else.**

> **Status:** Active development — v0.1.0. Compounding begins immediately. Gains become visible around session 10-20 as the audit log fills and skills get tuned to your patterns.

---

## Quick start

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajinkyabhanudas/youk/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

One command. The installer handles Docker build, MCP server registration, and CLAUDE.md patch. First run takes ~2 minutes (Docker image build). Re-runs are idempotent.

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop running · Claude Code installed · Python 3.11+

The installer prompts for your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` if it's not already in your environment — no pre-export needed.

Open any Claude Code session and start working. youk activates automatically. Type `/start` if you want to see the session card explicitly. By your second session, youk picks up where you left off without being asked.

**Verify the install:**

```bash
bash ~/.claude/youk/scripts/doctor.sh
```

`doctor.sh` checks every dependency and gives a specific `Fix:` line for anything that fails.

---

## How it works

youk is two Docker containers registered as MCP servers in Claude Code:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│           Claude Code           │
│         (MCP client)            │
└──────────┬──────────┬───────────┘
           │          │
    ┌──────▼──┐  ┌────▼──────┐
    │youk-core│  │youk-code  │
    │         │  │           │
    │session  │  │nfr_check  │
    │routing  │  │skills     │
    │health   │  │review     │
    └──────┬──┘  └────┬──────┘
           │          │
    ┌──────▼──────────▼──────┐
    │   ~/.claude/ (volume)  │
    │   skills, context,     │
    │   audit logs           │
    └────────────────────────┘
```

**youk-core** (read-write access):
- `session_start(project_dir)` — detects project type (Python/JS/Go/Rust), loads contracts + decisions, returns resume point
- `compact_context(project_dir)` — builds a tiered context brief from structured files; call at 25+ exchanges to preempt Claude's generic auto-compaction
- `session_end(summary, commits_made, explicit_contracts)` — writes audit log, saves working agreements to `contracts.md`
- `route_task(task)` — sizes the task (XS→XL), returns skill list and ceremony level
- `optimize_intent(raw_input)` — compresses vague/multi-part input into a structured intent brief before routing
- `check_command(command)` — enforces the no-destructive hard rule at tool level
- `self_heal()` — analyzes audit logs, generates improvement proposals
- `add_proposal(title, rationale, action, target, content)` — queue an improvement proposal to PENDING.md (called by skills and by Claude directly)
- `get_proposals()` / `apply_proposal(id, confirmed)` — proposal review and two-step apply; `apply_proposal` supports `CODE_EDIT` change_type to replace named functions in `.py` files within the youk repo
- `track_tokens(input_tokens, output_tokens, note)` — record token usage at a session checkpoint; `session_end` writes a `Tokens:` line to the audit log; `self_heal` uses this for cost trend detection across sessions

**youk-code** (read-only access):
- `nfr_check(task, size)` — XS/S: instant 2-question check; M: 4-question API block; L/XL: full check
- `route_to_skill(skill, task)` — loads any skill's SKILL.md and runs it against your task
- `check_commit_quality(message, file_paths)` — scores commit, blocks credential files
- `list_skills()` — lists all skills with health status; `has_skill_md: false` = gap
- `generate_skill(name, purpose, project_context, signal_type)` — generates a new SKILL.md from repo context + best-practices knowledge + skill schema
- `assess_skill(skill_name)` — assesses an existing skill against audit evidence and cross-project patterns; returns gaps + proposed additions
- `detect_skill_gaps()` — aggregates all signals (missing skills, audit gaps, uncovered best-practice patterns) into a prioritised list

Both containers mount `~/.claude/` via Docker volumes. youk-core has write access (writes session state, knowledge entries, audit logs). youk-code has read-only access (reads skills, config, context).

---

## Guard rails

Guard rails are machine-readable contracts in `config/guardrails.yaml`. Hard rules are enforced at the tool level — they block, not suggest.

**Hard rules (block):**

| Rule | What it stops |
|---|---|
| `no-auto-apply-proposals` | Self-heal proposals auto-applying without your review |
| `no-credential-commits` | `.env`, `*secret*`, `*api_key*` files entering a commit |
| `knowledge-extraction-not-logging` | Raw conversation transcripts being stored |
| `no-destructive-without-confirm` | `rm -rf`, `reset --hard`, force push without confirmation |

**Soft rules (suggest once, skippable):**

| Rule | What it surfaces |
|---|---|
| `nfr-before-m-tasks` | Run NFR check before M+ sized tasks |
| `spec-before-l-tasks` | Write a spec before L/XL tasks |
| `session-close-cluster` | context-sync + learn + humanize at session end |
| `adr-for-real-alternatives` | Document architectural decisions with rejected options |

To add or change a rule: edit `config/guardrails.yaml` and commit. Guard rails are not prompt instructions — they're versioned code.

For the full access hierarchy (volume mounts, tool-level enforcement, soft vs hard constraint taxonomy) see [docs/well-architected.md](docs/well-architected.md#mcp-access-hierarchy).

---

## Living knowledge

`knowledge/` stores what youk has learned — not what was said.

```
knowledge/
├── KNOWLEDGE-INDEX.md          ← health status, what exists
├── interpretation/
│   ├── user-intent.md          ← how your phrases map to actual intent
│   └── task-signals.md         ← what signals reveal task size
├── clarifications/
│   └── YYYY-MM/
│       └── YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md   ← one entry per intent-resolution case
├── projects/
│   └── {slug}/
│       ├── contracts.md        ← working agreements (loaded first every session)
│       ├── decisions.md        ← architectural decisions + rationale
│       ├── context.md          ← project type, tech stack, gate progress
│       └── research-inbox/     ← weekly stack briefings from project-research.py
│           └── YYYY-MM-DD-research.md
├── domain/                     ← symlink to your existing skill knowledge base
└── proposals/
    └── PENDING.md              ← self-heal proposals awaiting review
```

Each session, `compact_context` writes a checkpoint to `state/session-checkpoint.json`. The next `session_start` merges it as an audit entry automatically — so context is never lost even if you close the tab without typing `/done`. Raw transcripts are never stored — that's enforced by the `knowledge-extraction-not-logging` hard rule.

`self_heal` reads the last 30 days of audit logs and generates improvement proposals. Proposals sit in `PENDING.md` until you review and approve them via `apply_proposal(id, confirmed=True)`. `apply_proposal` supports `CODE_EDIT` (replace a named Python function in-repo), `SKILL_EDIT` (add or replace a section in a SKILL.md), and `CONFIG_EDIT` (patch YAML config files).

---

## Skill lifecycle

Skills are not static files — they generate and evolve from signals.

**Generation triggers:**
- `route_task` returns a skill with no SKILL.md (`has_skill_md: false` in `list_skills()`)
- Project type detected at session start with no domain skill (e.g. Python ML project, no `python-ml` skill)
- Best-practices pattern in `cross-project.md` not encoded in any existing skill
- Engineer explicitly requests a new skill

**Evolution triggers:**
- `self_heal()` returns `skill_gap_signals` — skills with recurring `SkillGap:` lines in audit logs
- Session ends with `skill_gaps={"skill-name": ["what was missed"]}` in `session_end()`
- `assess_skill()` called directly reveals coverage gaps

**The loop:**
```
repo context / audit signals
        ↓
generate_skill() or assess_skill()
        ↓
add_proposal()          ← queued to PENDING.md, never auto-applied
        ↓
apply_proposal(confirmed=True)   ← founder reviews and approves
        ↓
updated SKILL.md        ← read at runtime via volume mount, no rebuild
```

`knowledge/skill-schema.md` is the canonical template that drives generation — it defines required sections, phase structure, quality bar conventions, and anti-patterns. Generated skills follow the same structure as hand-written ones.

---

## Task routing

`route_task(task)` returns:

```json
{
  "size": "M",
  "ceremony": "standard",
  "skills": ["nfr_check", "dev_loop", "code_review", "verify"],
  "nfr_mode": "quick_4q",
  "token_budget": 75000,
  "warnings": ["NFR check recommended before this task"]
}
```

Sizes: **XS** (typo, clarification) → **S** (bug fix, config) → **M** (feature, refactor) → **L** (system, architecture) → **XL** (new project, migration)

Routing uses **net-score**: positive signal matches minus (negative matches × 2). "implement a typo fix" routes XS not M — the `typo` negative signal cancels the `implement` positive.

Routing logic lives in `config/routes.yaml` — readable, editable, committed. Token budgets per size: XS 5k · S 25k · M 75k · L 200k · XL 500k.

---

## Workflow commands

Five commands compose the underlying skills. Type them in Claude Code — youk routes silently.

| Command | Composes | When |
|---------|---------|------|
| `/start` | session_start → get_proposals → welcome card | Beginning any session — also "activate youk" |
| `/build` | route_task → nfr_check (M+) → dev-loop | Implementing a feature |
| `/done` | code-review → verify → humanize | Just finished implementing |
| `/check` | code-review → security-review (if auth in scope) | Before committing |
| `/decide` | adr | Making an architectural choice |
| `/health` | self_heal() | "How is the system doing?" |
| `/plan` | compact_context → session_plan rebuild | Refocus mid-session |

Aliases: `/requirements` → nfr_check · `/spec` → write-spec · `/review` → code-review

---

## Variants

youk is a platform. Each variant is one Docker image + one server file specialized for a domain:

| Variant | Domain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| youk-core | Session, routing, self-healing | Live |
| youk-code | Software engineering | Live |
| youk-pm | Product management, specs, ADRs | Planned |
| youk-research | Research, synthesis | Planned |
| youk-design | UX, Figma integration | Planned |
| youk-analytics | Production metrics loops | Planned |

Adding a variant means building one Dockerfile, one server.py, one entry in `config/variants.yaml`, and one `claude mcp add` command. The pattern is in [docs/variants.md](docs/variants.md).

---

## Context management

youk's context compaction runs proactively — before Claude's generic auto-compaction can blur behavioral contracts.

When new significant context is established — after a `route_to_skill` call, after a commit, when a decision is verbalized, before `session_end`, or after 8+ tool calls — Claude calls `compact_context(project_dir)`. The tool builds a brief from structured knowledge files, not by summarizing conversation. Content is tiered:

| Tier | What it is | How compacted |
|---|---|---|
| CONTRACT | Behavioral agreements (commit format, test cadence) | Preserved verbatim, always first |
| DECISION | Architectural choices with rationale | Key fact + 1-sentence rationale |
| EXPLORATION | Depth dives, explanations | 1 sentence |
| CLARIFICATION | One-shot Q&A | Dropped entirely, re-ask if needed |

Working agreements detected mid-session are saved via `session_end(explicit_contracts=[...])` to `knowledge/projects/{slug}/contracts.md`. Every future `session_start` loads them first. `compact_context` pins them in every brief. They are immune to compaction because they come from files, not conversation history.

---

## Cross-project learning

youk learns at three scopes: project, domain, global.

```
knowledge/
├── projects/
│   └── {slug}/
│       ├── contracts.md    ← working agreements (always loaded first)
│       ├── decisions.md    ← architectural decisions + rationale
│       └── context.md      ← project type, tech stack, gate progress
├── interpretation/         ← how your phrases map to intent (global)
└── proposals/
    └── PENDING.md          ← self-heal proposals awaiting review
```

`knowledge/cross-project.md` contains best-practice patterns that feed `generate_skill()` and `assess_skill()` at generation time. `self_heal()` surfaces recurring `SkillGap:` signals from audit logs as proposals — these become `cross-project.md` additions after you review and approve them via `apply_proposal(confirmed=True)`.

**Zero footprint in your repo.** All knowledge writes to `~/.claude/youk/knowledge/`. Your project's git history is untouched. youk reads your project (project type detection, git log for resume point), never writes to it.

---

## Development commands

```bash
# Build both images
make build

# Run tests (tools/list handshake)
make test

# Full rebuild from scratch
make rebuild

# Health check with actionable Fix: lines
bash scripts/doctor.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

**Run `doctor.sh` first — it diagnoses and gives Fix: lines for every known failure:**

```bash
bash ~/.claude/youk/scripts/doctor.sh
```

**`claude mcp list` shows youk-core/youk-code as disconnected**

Docker may not be running, or the images need rebuilding. Doctor will tell you which.

**`compact_context` returns empty contracts**

No contracts have been saved yet for this project. Call `session_end` with `explicit_contracts=[...]` at the end of your first session to seed them.

**Build fails with `COPY servers/shared/ /shared/` error**

Build must run from the repo root. The Makefile handles this — use `make build`, not `docker build` directly.

---

## Philosophy

Eight principles drive every design decision in youk. The full document is [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md). The short version:

1. **Ambient over activated** — no "activate" phrase, always on
2. **Extract, don't log** — knowledge is insights, not transcripts
3. **Propose, never auto-apply** — self-healing requires founder approval
4. **Guard rails are versioned contracts** — committed YAML, not prompt text
5. **Ceremony proportional to risk** — XS task gets no ceremony, XL task gets full architecture review
6. **Variants are forms of intelligence** — specialization, not sprawl
7. **The repo is the truth** — everything important is in git
8. **Build the foundation right, then build fast** — Phase 1 is permanent

---

## Contributing

youk is a personal system in active development. Issues and pull requests are welcome, but changes that affect the guard rail contracts or knowledge structure need explicit discussion first — those are the load-bearing walls.
